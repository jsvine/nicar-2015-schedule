Veteran data crunchers and programmers from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we\u2019ll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.\n\nYou\u2019ll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.\n\nAdditional details including the schedule for the workshop can be found on the conference website.\n\nRegister for this workshop."

Fortunately, the Internet is stock-full of examples and answers to help you.\n\nIn this class, we'll share tips on how to teach yourself to code by working with others' code, reverse-engineering example code to make it do what you want, and adapting open source libraries. In the process, we'll demo browser dev tools to show you how to inspect work by other outlets and see how websites function the behind the scenes. We'll also demonstrate how those same tools can help you inspect webpages you've built to fix problems and test how the website will look on various devices. The class will focus on sharing tips on reading and reverse-engineering others' code; finding answers to tricky questions and code examples on StackOverflow, CSSTricks, CodePen etc.; and pulling down and using GitHub repos from other news outlets.\n\nRequirements: Code curiosity and a stubborn devotion to figuring out how things work. It's recommended that you set up a (free) Github account ahead of time and complete Code School's free courses on HTML/CSS, Javascript and Git."

This computerized evidence \u201cconfrontation\u201d helped me clean up errors in my scripts and ensured the story held fewer surprises for them...or me. These preplication files then became the replication files we posted for our readers. In this session, we'll examine and run these files in Rstudio. You'll learn about pitfalls and best practices in such pre-publication file-sharing, which are matters of journalism practice not confined to a particular application or language.

We're not building a site here, but we should leave this panel with a clear idea of what the features of a data smells compendium would be. A wiki seems like an obvious choice, but how does an entry look? How do we organize and collect these smells? What can we do to automate the tedious process of vetting a data set? We'll explore these questions. The session will begin with a basic exploration of the concept of data smells. From there we will discuss several questions about how to build a site for cataloguing data smells: * How do we document data smells? * Where do we host this site? * What are all the points in the reporting process where errors occur? * Checklists? Can we automate smell checks? * Can we bundle smells for common types of data into guides? * Can we make the data smells idea approachable for readers?\n\nThis session is good for: Reporters, developers and researchers.
